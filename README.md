# AdministratorPortal
Administrator web portal that allow moderators and system admins to manage the content on a mobile application that is called "Market". This administrator web portal is only a small part of my final year project at Swinburne University and it is developed in HTML,CSS,JavaScript and uses Bootstrap, AngularJS for the front end and uses ExpressJS for the back-end. In addition, it also uses Firebase real-time database, cloud functions, authentication services and storage.
